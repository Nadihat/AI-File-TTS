# AI-File-TTS

This is an idea for a program that takes a PDF or EPub and transforms it into TTS. I am focused on TTS more than RAG: holding the entire book in context is more reliable content-wise in my opinion.

Even if I don't develop it, somebody will eventually find it and design it, without me having had to expend any effort.
