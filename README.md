# AI-File-TTS

This is an idea for a program that takes a PDF or EPub and transforms it into TTS. I am focused on TTS more than RAG: holding the entire book in context is more reliable content-wise in my opinion.

Even if I don't develop it, somebody will eventually find it and design it, without me having had to expend any effort.

The original inspiration was catering to people who learn best with audio rather than visual.

For simple/test tasks, an easier option would be uploading the file to an user friendly UI that supports TTS and then using that, such as the proprietary chatgpt.com , OpenWebUI, even SillyTavern, etc.

Then again a file (particularly EPubs/CSVs/TXTs) just could be fed to a TTS model.
